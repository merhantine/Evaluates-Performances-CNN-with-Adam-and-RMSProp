# Evaluates Performances CNN with-Adam and RMSProp

This repo shares my research codes in 2020 that evaluates CNN architectures namely AlexNet, ResNet and DenseNet with **6 distinct learning rates**, and combining with optimizers of **Adam and RMSProp**. This research were collaboration me and my supervisor, Iman Herwidiana Kartowisastro and had been published in 2020 by ***International Journal of Advanced Trends in Computer Science and Engineering***. You can go to this link: https://www.warse.org/IJATCSE/static/pdf/file/ijatcse256952020.pdf for getting details.

We used dataset from Snapshot Serengeti season 1 with 11 imbalances classes from various views of wild animals. They were captured in front, side, behind views and even just part of their bodies. Hopefully all of you could get new insights for your experiments or research.
